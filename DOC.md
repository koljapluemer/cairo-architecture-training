Simple Vue project.

Words are an array of 100 words, generated with chatGPT:

```
can you give me the 100 most common arabic words with <5 letters, in the format 

[("manzil", "منزل", "house"), ]
```

Everything happens in `App.vue` (apart from `words.js`, which is just the aforementioned array). Code is super simple. Please keep using composition API. Links work by generating a forvo URL.
